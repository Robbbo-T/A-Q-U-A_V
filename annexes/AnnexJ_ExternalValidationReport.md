|:-----------|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|:----------------------------------------|
| **MAJOR-01** | `[e.g., DO-178C, Section 6.2]` | [e.g., "Traceability from low-level requirements to source code was found to be incomplete for module XYZ."] | [e.g., "AQUA V. shall perform a full traceability audit and update the compliance matrix. Evidence to be provided within 30 days."] |

### 4.2 Minor Findings
*A Minor Finding indicates a deviation that does not immediately impact safety but must be addressed.*

| Finding ID | Requirement/Standard Reference | Description of Non-Compliance | Required Corrective Action Plan (CAP) |

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This document establishes the mandatory standards and governance model for all interfaces—technical, data, and operational—between the Q-Divisions of AQUA V. Its purpose is to ensure seamless integration, eliminate data silos, promote reusability, and provide a clear framework for resolving cross-divisional dependencies.

### 1.2 Scope

This standard applies to all new and existing interfaces between any of the defined AQUA V. Q-Divisions. It covers system-to-system integrations, data exchange protocols, and inter-departmental operational workflows.

## 2. Guiding Principles

All inter-divisional interfaces SHALL adhere to the following principles:

* **Loose Coupling, High Cohesion:** Interfaces should be designed to minimize dependencies between divisions while ensuring each division maintains strong internal coherence.
* **API-First:** All data and service exchanges SHALL be exposed via standardized, version-controlled APIs managed on the enterprise API Gateway.
* **Single Source of Truth:** Data SHALL be owned by a single Q-Division. Other divisions access this data via the defined API; data duplication is strictly prohibited.
* **Security by Design:** All interfaces must be designed with "Zero Trust" security principles and incorporate post-quantum cryptography where applicable.

## 3. Interface Governance Model

* **Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB):** The EAB, led by `QDAT`, is the ultimate authority for approving all new cross-divisional interfaces.
* **Interface Control Documents (ICD):** Every interface between two systems owned by different Q-Divisions SHALL be formally documented in a dedicated ICD artifact, compliant with the v12.3 nomenclature.
* **Service Level Agreements (SLA):** For operational interfaces, a formal SLA must be established, defining uptime, performance, and support commitments.

## 4. Technical Interface Matrix

*This matrix defines the primary technical interaction points between key Q-Divisions.*

| From Division | To Division | Primary Interface Type     | Key Systems Involved              | Governing ICD (Example) |
| :------------ | :---------- | :------------------------- | :-------------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| **QPOW**      | **QSTR**    | Structural Loads Data      | Propulsion Testbeds → FEA Models  | `...-DES-ICD-DAT-...`   |
| **QHPC**      | **QSCI**    | High-Performance Computing | HPC Cluster → Quantum Simulations | `...-DEV-API-API-...`   |
| **QIND**      | **QMEC**    | Manufacturing Requirements | PLM System → Robotics Control     | `...-PRD-ICD-SFT-...`   |
| **QDAT**      | **All**     | Data Governance Policies   | Master Data Hub → All Systems     | `...-OPS-POL-DAT-...`   |

## 5. Data Interface Standards

* **Standard Protocol:** All new synchronous data exchanges SHALL use **RESTful APIs with JSON payloads**.
* **Standard Messaging:** All new asynchronous data exchanges SHALL use the enterprise **Kafka message bus**.
* **Data Dictionary:** All data elements exchanged between divisions SHALL be defined in the **AQUA V. Enterprise Data Dictionary**, managed by `QDAT`.
* **Authentication:** All API calls SHALL be authenticated using **OAuth 2.0** with quantum-resistant tokens.

## 6. Operational Interface Protocols

*This section defines the "rules of engagement" for operational handoffs.*

* **Maintenance to Operations (`QMEC` → `QGRO`):** A formal "Return to Service" digital certificate SHALL be issued from the Maintenance Management System to the Operations Control Center before an asset can be declared operational.
* **Design to Production (`QSTR` → `QIND`):** A design is not considered "released to manufacturing" until the CDR artifact is formally approved and all associated CAD models pass the automated quality checks.

## 7. Change Management Process

Any proposed change to an existing, approved interface SHALL follow the official enterprise Management of Change (MOC) process.

1. **Submission:** The requesting Q-Division submits an **Engineering Change Proposal (ECP)**.
2. **Impact Assessment:** The EAB and all affected Q-Divisions assess the technical, financial, and operational impact.
3. **Approval:** The EAB approves or rejects the change.
4. **Implementation:** The change is implemented, and the relevant ICD and SLA documents are updated to a new version.

## 8. Appendix: Q-Division Responsibilities

* **QSTR / QAIR / QMEC:** Responsible for defining the physical and performance requirements of their components.
* **QPOW:** Responsible for defining power and thermal interface requirements.
* **QDAT:** Responsible for defining data format, governance, and API standards.
* **QHPC:** Responsible for providing the underlying compute and network infrastructure.
* **QIND:** Responsible for defining manufacturing data interface requirements.

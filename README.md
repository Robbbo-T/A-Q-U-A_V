# ANNEX D: Official Nomenclature System v9.0 (FINAL)

**Document Status:** ✅ Complete & Validated  
**Version:** 9.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-02

---

## 1.0 Introduction & Philosophy

The AQUA V. Nomenclature System v9.0 is the foundational pillar of our Digital Thread. It is not merely an identification code; it is a machine-readable, semantically rich, and immutable system designed to provide absolute clarity, traceability, and configuration control for every artifact—physical or digital—across the enterprise.

**Core Principles:**
- **Immutability:** Once an identifier is assigned, it is permanent and can never be reused.
- **Semantic Clarity:** Each field in the identifier has a precise, unambiguous meaning.
- **Machine Readability:** The structured, delimited format is optimized for automated parsing, indexing, and data management.
- **Decoupled Governance:** The technical identifier is decoupled from organizational structures, ensuring stability even as teams evolve.

> This system is a formal Configuration Item (CI) and its governance is managed by the QDAT-DataGov division.

---

## 2.0 Core Structure

The system utilizes two primary formats depending on the scope of the artifact.

### 2.1 Product-Specific Format (11 Fields)

Used for any artifact directly related to a specific product or subproduct.

```
LINE-PRODUCT-SUBPRODUCT-MSN-PHASE-SUBTYPE-DOMAIN-MTD-REALIDAD-UTCS-VERSION
```

### 2.2 Cross-Program Format (8 Fields)

Used for general corporate artifacts not tied to a single product (e.g., corporate policies, facility plans, cross-program research).

```

# ANNEX G: Universal Technology Classification System (UTCS) v1.3

**Document Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Version:** 1.3  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-16

---

## 1.0 Introduction & Purpose

The Universal Technology Classification System (UTCS) is a comprehensive, 10-domain taxonomy designed to provide a standardized framework for classifying all technologies, components, systems, and processes across AQUA V.  
It is the primary system for populating the UTCS field in the Nomenclature System v9.0 ([ANNEX D](#)).

**The purpose of the UTCS is to:**
- Enable precise and consistent technology identification.
- Facilitate cross-program data analysis and technology mapping.
- Support strategic planning, R&D investment decisions, and intellectual property management.
- Create a common language for technical discussions across all Q-Divisions and global sites.

---

## 2.0 System Architecture

The UTCS uses a 3-level hierarchical structure, providing increasing granularity at each level.  
**The 9-digit code is formatted as:** `DDD-CC-SS`

- **Domain (DDD):** The first 3 digits represent one of the 10 high-level technology domains.
- **Class (CC):** The next 2 digits define a major system or technology group within that domain.
- **Sub-Class (SS):** The final 2 digits provide the most granular classification for a specific component, technology, or process.

**Example:**  
A code of `024-50-10` would be interpreted as:  
- **Domain 024:** Aerospace Technology (ATA) - Electrical Power  
- **Class 50:** Electrical Power - Generation  
- **Sub-Class 10:** AC Generation

## 5.0 Profitability & Cash Flow Analysis

- **EBITDA Positive:** Projected 2034
- **Net Profit Positive:** Projected 2037
- **Free Cash Flow Positive:** Projected 2039 (after main CapEx and R&D phases)
- **Peak Funding Requirement:** Max cash deficit in 2036, with €35B of €40B investment deployed

---

## 6.0 Sensitivity Analysis

The model has been stress-tested against key scenarios:

- **Entry-Into-Service Delay:** 2-year delay in BWB-Q100 pushes FCF positivity out 3 years, but diversified product revenues protect viability.
- **R&D Overrun:** 20% overrun in Quantum R&D can be absorbed by contingency capital.
- **Lower Market Penetration:** 25% reduction in market share still yields a profitable business, though with a lower terminal valuation.

*The model demonstrates resilience to single-point failures—a key strength of the four-pillar product strategy.*

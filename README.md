### E.2 Category Usage Guidelines

#### Primary Category Assignment
Each artifact must be assigned exactly one primary category based on its main purpose and content. The primary category is determined by the artifact's core function and intended use.

#### Secondary Category Considerations
While each artifact has only one primary category, it may have relevance to multiple categories. For example:
- A technical manual (TEC) might contain maintenance procedures (MRO)
- A financial report (FIN) might include sustainability metrics (CES)
- A regulatory document (REG) might reference technical specifications (TEC)

#### Category Selection Criteria
When assigning a category, consider:
1. **Primary Purpose**: What is the main reason the artifact exists?
2. **Target Audience**: Who is the primary user of the artifact?
3. **Content Focus**: What type of information predominates in the artifact?
4. **Lifecycle Stage**: In which phase of the lifecycle is the artifact primarily used?

#### Special Cases
- **Cross-Functional Artifacts**: For artifacts that serve multiple purposes equally, choose the category that best represents the primary stakeholder or most critical function.
- **Evolving Artifacts**: If an artifact's purpose changes over time, update its category to reflect its current primary use.
- **Compound Artifacts**: For artifacts containing multiple distinct sections, consider splitting them into separate artifacts with appropriate categories.

2. System prompts for required nomenclature fields
3. System validates inputs and generates complete nomenclature
4. Nomenclature is embedded in document metadata and headers

#### Field Mapping
Template fields map directly to nomenclature components:

| Template Field | Nomenclature Field | Example |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Product Line | LINE | AMP |
| Product Type | PRODUCT | BWB |
| Model/Variant | SUBPRODUCT | Q100 |
| Document Type | DOC | AMM |
| Application Module | APP | TSG |
| Task/Method | MTD | TR-VF-FC27 |
| Reality State | REALIDAD | RDIG |
| Technology Class | UTCS | 024500000 |

#### Example Integration
For an Aircraft Maintenance Manual troubleshooting procedure:
1. User selects "Maintenance Procedure" template
2. System prompts for:
   - Product Line: AMPEL360
   - Product: BWB
   - Subproduct: Q100
   - MSN: 25MAP0001
   - Document Type: AMM
   - Application: TSG
3. System generates nomenclature:
   `AMP-BWB-Q100-25MAP0001-MNT-AMM-TSG-TR-VF-FC27-RDIG-024-50-00-v1.0.0`
4. Nomenclature is embedded in document and registered in configuration database

### O.1 Framework Overview

#### Framework Vision
The Well Invented Reality framework represents a paradigm shift in how intelligent systems understand and interact with their environment. Rather than operating in isolation with raw technical data, WIR-enabled systems possess contextual awareness that allows them to understand their purpose, constraints, and relationship to broader objectives.

#### Framework Objectives
- **Contextual Awareness**: Enable systems to understand their operational context
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure system decisions align with mission and vision
- **Ethical Operation**: Embed ethical considerations into system behavior
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Allow systems to adapt to changing contexts and requirements
- **Human-Centric Design**: Ensure systems serve human needs and values

#### Framework Scope
- **System Scope**: All intelligent systems within AQUA V.
- **Technology Scope**: AI systems, quantum systems, autonomous systems
- **Application Scope**: Decision support, control systems, analytical systems
- **Lifecycle Scope**: Design, development, operation, and evolution of systems

#### Key Benefits
- **Improved Decision Quality**: Contextually-aware decisions are better informed
- **Enhanced Autonomy**: Systems can operate more independently with contextual understanding
- **Ethical Assurance**: Ethical constraints are built into system behavior
- **Adaptability**: Systems can adapt to changing contexts and requirements
- **Human Trust**: Contextual awareness increases human trust in autonomous systems

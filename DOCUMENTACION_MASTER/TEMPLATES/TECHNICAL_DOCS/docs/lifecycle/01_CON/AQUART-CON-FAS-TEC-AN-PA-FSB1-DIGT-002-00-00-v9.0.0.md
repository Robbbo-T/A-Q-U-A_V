## 2. Evaluation Criteria
The following criteria will be used to assess the technical feasibility of each alternative. Each criterion is weighted based on its importance to program success.

| Criterion | Description | Weight (%) |
|:-----------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------|:-----------|
| **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** | Maturity of the core technology (Scale 1-9). | 30% |
| **Integration Complexity** | Difficulty of integrating with existing AQUA V. systems. | 20% |
| **Performance Potential** | Ability to meet or exceed key performance requirements. | 20% |
| **Development Risk** | Likelihood of significant technical hurdles during development. | 15% |
| **Scalability & Extensibility** | Ease of scaling the solution and adapting for future needs. | 10% |
| **Internal Skill Availability** | Availability of required expertise within AQUA V. | 5% |
| **Total** | | **100%** |

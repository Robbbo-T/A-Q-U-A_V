## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Description of Proposed Change
This document assesses the organizational impact of implementing the **[Program/System Name]**. This program will introduce [describe the change, e.g., "a new line of autonomous maintenance robots (ROB-MRO)", "a quantum-based design optimization software (QUA-QSW-QOPT)"] with the objective of [state the primary business goal, e.g., "reducing maintenance turnaround time by 30%", "accelerating design cycles by 50%"].

### 1.2 Summary of Organizational Impact
The overall organizational impact is assessed as **[LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH]**.

*   **Key Positive Impacts:** [e.g., "Increased efficiency in the MRO division", "Upskilling of design engineers"].
*   **Key Challenges:** [e.g., "Significant process re-engineering required", "Potential resistance from workforce due to automation fears", "Identified skills gap in quantum algorithm maintenance"].
*   **Recommendation:** A **[e.g., "dedicated change management team" or "phased rollout with extensive training"]** is required to ensure successful adoption.

## 2. Detailed Impact Analysis

### 2.1 Organizational Structure and Governance
*   **Description of Impact:** [e.g., "Will require the creation of a new 'Robotic Maintenance Operations' team within the QGRO division. The lead of this team will report to the Director of Ground Operations."]
*   **Impact Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
*   **Required Actions:** [e.g., "Define new team charter and job descriptions", "Update enterprise organizational chart", "Establish governance model for human-robot collaboration"].

### 2.2 Business Processes and Workflows
*   **Description of Impact:** [e.g., "The current manual inspection workflow (WI-123) will be deprecated. A new workflow for scheduling, deploying, and reviewing data from MRO robots must be created. This affects maintenance planners, technicians, and quality assurance."]
*   **Impact Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
*   **Required Actions:** [e.g., "Map current vs. future state processes", "Develop and document new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)", "Integrate new workflow into the central ERP system"].

### 2.3 Roles, Responsibilities, and Skills
*   **Description of Impact:** [e.g., "The 'Maintenance Technician' role will evolve into a 'Robotics Supervisor' role, shifting focus from manual tasks to system monitoring and exception handling. A new role, 'Quantum Sensor Calibration Specialist', will be required."]
*   **Skills Gap Analysis:**
    *   **Required Skills:** [e.g., "Robotic systems programming", "Data analysis", "Quantum sensor physics"].
    *   **Existing Skills:** [e.g., "Strong mechanical/avionics expertise"].
    *   **Identified Gaps:** [e.g., "Lack of widespread data analytics and programming skills in the MRO workforce"].
*   **Impact Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
*   **Required Actions:** [e.g., "Develop a comprehensive upskilling and reskilling training program", "Initiate hiring for 2x Quantum Sensor Calibration Specialists"].

### 2.4 Technology and Tools
*   **Description of Impact:** [e.g., "Technicians will need to be trained on the 'Robbbo-T Mission Control' software. The current parts ordering system must be integrated with the robot's predictive maintenance alerts via a new API."]
*   **Impact Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
*   **Required Actions:** [e.g., "Procure licenses for new software", "Develop and test API integration", "Deploy new hardware (tablets) to the maintenance floor"].

### 2.5 Culture and People
*   **Description of Impact:** [e.g., "Introduction of automation may cause anxiety about job security. A shift from a 'fix-it' culture to a 'predict and prevent' data-driven culture is necessary."]
*   **Impact Level:** [High / Medium / Low]
*   **Required Actions:** [e.g., "Develop a proactive internal communications plan emphasizing the evolution of roles, not replacement", "Launch a 'MRO of the Future' campaign", "Establish feedback channels to address employee concerns"].

## 3. Stakeholder Impact Summary

| Stakeholder Group | Nature of Impact (Positive/Negative/Neutral) | Key Concerns / Interests |
|:------------------------|:---------------------------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Maintenance Technicians** | Mixed: Reduced physical labor (+), requires new skills (-), fear of replacement (-) | Job security, quality of training, ease of use of new tools. |
| **QIND Division** | Positive: Increased demand for MRO robots. | Production ramp-up, supply chain stability. |
| **Airline Customers** | Positive: Faster turnaround times, higher reliability. | Cost of new services, data privacy of operational data. |
| **Safety Regulators** | Neutral: Will require new certification approaches. | Validation of autonomous systems, software reliability. |

## 4. Change Readiness Assessment
*   **Leadership Alignment:** [Is leadership fully aligned and sponsoring the change? High/Medium/Low]
*   **Organizational Capacity:** [Does the organization have the resources (time, people, budget) to absorb this change? High/Medium/Low]
*   **Past Experience with Change:** [How has the organization handled similar large-scale changes in the past? Successfully/Mixed/Poorly]
*   **Overall Readiness Score:** [Provide a summary score or assessment, e.g., "The organization is moderately ready but requires strong leadership communication and a formal change management structure to succeed."]

## 5. Recommendations and High-Level Change Management Plan
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended to ensure a successful transition:

1.  **Establish a formal Change Management Office (CMO)** for this program, led by a dedicated Change Manager.
2.  **Develop a Proactive Communication Plan:** Initiate communications immediately to build awareness and manage concerns.
3.  **Launch a Phased Training Program:** Begin with foundational data literacy and progress to system-specific training.
4.  **Implement a Pilot Program:** Roll out the new system in a single, controlled location (e.g., Madrid MRO) to gather feedback and refine processes before enterprise-wide deployment.
5.  **Define and Track Success Metrics:** Establish KPIs for both technical implementation (e.g., uptime) and organizational adoption (e.g., employee satisfaction, training completion rates).

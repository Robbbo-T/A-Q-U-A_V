## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the comprehensive technical and operational requirements for the **[System/Program Name]**. It serves as the authoritative source for all subsequent design, development, testing, and certification activities. The requirements herein are mandatory for program success.

### 1.2 Scope
This specification applies to all aspects of the **[System/Program Name]**, from initial design through to operational deployment.

*   **In Scope:** [Clearly define what is covered, e.g., "The hardware and software of the Quantum Navigation System (QNS)", "The assembly procedures for the MRO-AC01 robot"].
*   **Out of Scope:** [Clearly define what is not covered, e.g., "Ground Support Equipment (GSE) is covered in a separate RQS", "Third-party satellite link protocols"].

### 1.3 System Overview
The **[System/Program Name]** is a [describe the system's high-level purpose and function]. Its primary objective is to [state the main goal, e.g., "provide GPS-independent navigation for all AMPEL360 aircraft", "automate 80% of routine maintenance inspections"]. It interacts with [list key external systems, e.g., "the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) core", "the central maintenance database"].

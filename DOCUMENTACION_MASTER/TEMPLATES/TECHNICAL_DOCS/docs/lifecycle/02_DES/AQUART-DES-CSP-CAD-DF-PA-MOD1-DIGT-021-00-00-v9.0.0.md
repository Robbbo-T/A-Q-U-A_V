## 1. Purpose, Scope, and Compliance

### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the mandatory standards for all 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models and related data created within the AQUA V. program. The purpose is to ensure consistency, quality, and interoperability across all Q-Divisions and product lines, enabling a seamless Digital Thread.

### 1.2 Scope
These standards apply to all personnel involved in the creation, modification, and use of 3D models for all AQUA V. products and projects, including suppliers and partners. The primary CAD system for AQUA V. is **[Specify CAD Software, e.g., CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE]**.

### 1.3 Compliance
Compliance with this standard is **mandatory**. All models must pass the validation checks outlined in Section 8 before being released into the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system.

---

## 2. General Modeling Principles
*   **Design Intent:** Models SHALL be created to clearly capture and reflect their design intent. The model history should be logical and easy to understand.
*   **Robustness:** Models SHALL be robust and stable. Modifications to parent features or sketches SHALL not result in unexpected failures of child features.
*   **Simplicity:** Create the simplest possible model that accurately represents the design. Avoid unnecessarily complex features or history trees.
*   **Performance:** Models SHALL be optimized for performance, especially large assemblies. Use simplified representations where appropriate.

---

## 3. Part Modeling Standards

### 3.1 Sketching and Feature Creation
*   All sketches SHALL be **fully constrained** before being used to create a feature.
*   Sketches SHALL be attached to base planes (XY, YZ, XZ) or robust reference geometry.
*   The first feature of a part model SHALL be located at the model's **origin (0,0,0)**.

### 3.2 Parametric Design and Naming Conventions
*   Key driving dimensions SHALL be linked to a central parameters file or design table.
*   All significant features, parameters, and constraints SHALL be given meaningful names.
    *   **Good Naming:** `Extrude_MainBody`, `Param_Wing_Span`, `Constraint_EngineMount_Coincident`.
    *   **Bad Naming:** `Extrude.1`, `Parameter.123`, `Constraint.5`.

### 3.3 Material Properties
*   All part models SHALL have a material assigned from the official **AQUA V. Material Library**.
*   The assigned material MUST match the specification on the corresponding design documentation.

---

## 4. Assembly Modeling Standards

### 4.1 Assembly Structure and Constraints
*   Assemblies SHALL be structured logically to reflect the manufacturing or installation process.
*   Components SHALL be fully constrained within an assembly using the minimum number of constraints necessary.
*   Use of **assembly-level features** (e.g., cuts, holes) is restricted and requires justification. Part modifications should be done at the part level.

### 4.2 Simplified Representations
*   For large assemblies, lightweight or simplified representations SHALL be used to improve performance.
*   Create and manage configurations for different states (e.g., `As-Designed`, `As-Machined`, `Simplified_for_FEA`).

---

## 5. Model-Based Definition (MBD) and Annotation

### 5.1 Product and Manufacturing Information (PMI)
*   AQUA V. operates on a **Model-Based Definition (MBD)** principle. The 3D model is the single source of truth. 2D drawings are for reference or specific use cases only.
*   All PMI (dimensions, tolerances, notes, surface finishes) SHALL be applied directly to the 3D model in semantically-queriable format.

### 5.2 Geometric Dimensioning & Tolerancing (GD&T)
*   All GD&T applied to the model SHALL comply with **ASME Y14.5** or **ISO 1101** standards, as specified by the project.
*   GD&T annotations must be machine-readable to support automated inspection (CMM) and tolerance analysis.

---

## 6. Data Exchange and Neutral Formats
*   **Internal Exchange:** Native CAD format (`[e.g., .CATPart, .CATProduct]`) is used.
*   **External Exchange (Suppliers/Partners):** The standard neutral format is **STEP AP242**. This format includes PMI and GD&T data.
*   **Visualization/VR/AR:** The standard lightweight format is **JT** or **glTF**.

---

## 7. Configuration Management and PLM Integration
*   All CAD models are Configuration Items (CIs) and SHALL be managed within the **AQUA V. PLM System**.
*   The filename of a CAD model MUST exactly match its assigned part/assembly number (`nomenclature`).
*   A new revision of a model is required for any form, fit, or function change.

---

## 8. Model Validation and Quality Checks
Before any model is released, it SHALL pass an automated validation check. The checker will verify:
| Check ID | Item | Pass/Fail Criteria |
|:---------|:-----|:-------------------|
| **QUAL-01** | **History Tree** | No failed features in the model history. |
| **QUAL-02** | **Constraints** | All sketches and assembly components are fully constrained. |
| **QUAL-03** | **Properties** | Material is assigned from the standard library. |
| **QUAL-04** | **PMI** | Model contains required MBD annotations. |
| **QUAL-05** | **Interference** | No unintentional clashes or interferences in assemblies. |
```**
